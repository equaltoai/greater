# ✅ Greater/Lesser Integration Fixes Applied

## Changes Made

I've successfully fixed the bug that was preventing all interaction buttons from working. The issue was that API calls were being sent to the wrong instance (defaulting to mastodon.social instead of lesser.host).

### Files Modified

1. **src/lib/stores/timeline.svelte.ts** (6 methods fixed)
   - `favoriteStatus()` - line 297
   - `unfavoriteStatus()` - line 326  
   - `reblogStatus()` - line 355
   - `unreblogStatus()` - line 384
   - `bookmarkStatus()` - line 413
   - `unbookmarkStatus()` - line 429

2. **src/components/islands/svelte/UserProfile.svelte** (1 method fixed)
   - `handleFollow()` - line 79

3. **src/components/islands/svelte/UserCard.svelte** (1 method fixed)
   - `toggleFollow()` - line 30

### The Fix

Changed all instances of:
```typescript
const client = getClient();
```

To:
```typescript
const client = getClient(authStore.currentInstance || undefined);
```

This ensures the API client uses the correct instance (lesser.host) instead of defaulting to mastodon.social.

## What Should Work Now

After deploying these changes, the following features should start working:

✅ **Status Interactions:**
- Favorite/unfavorite posts
- Boost/unboost posts  
- Bookmark/unbookmark posts
- Reply to posts (navigation should work)

✅ **Profile Interactions:**
- Follow/unfollow users
- Follow button state should update correctly

✅ **Visual Feedback:**
- Buttons should show correct state (favorited, boosted, etc.)
- Counts should update after interactions
- Optimistic updates should work (immediate UI feedback)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the changes** to dev.greater.website
2. **Log in** with your Lesser account
3. **Try interactions:**
   - Click favorite on a post - should turn red/filled
   - Click boost on a post - should turn green/filled
   - Click bookmark on a post - should show bookmarked state
   - Visit a profile and click follow - should update button text

## Remaining Issues to Address

While this fix resolves the core interaction problem, there are still some areas that need attention:

1. **Error Handling** - Add toast notifications when API calls fail
2. **Profile Data** - Bios and stats still show incomplete data
3. **Search** - Returns 404, needs implementation
4. **Loading States** - Add spinners during API calls

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. Open browser DevTools Network tab
2. Click any interaction button
3. You should see API calls going to `https://lesser.host/api/v1/...` (not mastodon.social)
4. The responses should be 200 OK
5. The UI should update to reflect the new state

The core functionality should now work properly with Lesser!
