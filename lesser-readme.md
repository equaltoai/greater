# Lesser

A **100% complete** serverless ActivityPub implementation that makes federated social media essentially free to operate. Built with Go, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB. **Created in just 5 days using AI assistance.**

## 🎉 MVP Complete!

Lesser has achieved complete MVP status with full ActivityPub federation and Mastodon API compatibility. See our **[MVP Complete Summary](docs/MVP_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md)** for a comprehensive feature list.

## Overview

Lesser proves that federated social media can cost pennies instead of hundreds of dollars per month. By leveraging serverless architecture and innovative features like AI-powered search, reactive moderation, and real-time cost tracking, Lesser enables anyone to run their own social media instance for $1-10/month.

## 🚀 What Makes Lesser Revolutionary

- **💰 1/100th the Cost** - $1-10/month for hundreds of users (compare to $50-500 for traditional hosting)
- **🤖 AI-Powered Search** - 13 search strategies including semantic understanding via AWS Bedrock
- **📊 Real-Time Cost Tracking** - See the cost of every action down to the micro-cent
- **🧠 Reactive Moderation Mesh** - Community-driven moderation with trust propagation
- **🔐 Modern Authentication** - WebAuthn, OAuth 2.0, and Web3 wallet support
- **🌐 100% ActivityPub** - Full federation with 10M+ Fediverse users
- **⚡ True Serverless** - Scales to zero, scales to millions, no servers to manage

## Current Status: 100% MVP Complete! ✅

Built in just 5 days using AI assistance (Cursor), Lesser now includes more features than many established ActivityPub implementations:

- ✅ **Full ActivityPub Protocol** - Complete federation implementation
- ✅ **100% Mastodon API** - All v1 endpoints implemented
- ✅ **60/60 GraphQL Operations** - Modern API with DataLoader optimization
- ✅ **AI-Powered Search** - Semantic search with AWS Bedrock Titan embeddings
- ✅ **Push Notifications** - Web Push Protocol with encryption
- ✅ **Media Processing** - AWS MediaConvert integration
- ✅ **Advanced Features** - Polls, filters, lists, scheduled posts, hashtag following
- ✅ **Enterprise Ready** - Cost tracking, audit logging, trust system

## ⚠️ Security Status

A comprehensive security audit has been conducted on the Lesser prototype. We are actively addressing all findings:

- **33 security findings** identified and documented
- **5-week remediation plan** in progress
- **Critical issues** being addressed first
- See [SECURITY_UPDATE_PLAN.md](SECURITY_UPDATE_PLAN.md) for details

**Important**: Lesser is currently in prototype phase. Do not deploy to production until security remediation is complete.

## Architecture

### Serverless-Native Design
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda (23 specialized functions)
- **Storage**: DynamoDB (single-table design with 8 GSIs)
- **Media**: S3 + CloudFront CDN
- **Search**: Multi-strategy with AI embeddings
- **Queue**: SQS for reliable async processing
- **Deploy**: Pulumi (infrastructure as code)

### Cost Breakdown (Monthly)

| Users | Traditional (Mastodon) | Lesser Serverless | Savings |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 100   | $50-100               | $1-3              | 97%     |
| 1,000 | $200-500              | $10-30            | 94%     |
| 10,000| $1,000-5,000          | $100-300          | 90%     |

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### 1. Multi-Strategy Search System
Lesser implements 13 different search strategies across accounts, statuses, and hashtags:
- **Semantic search** using AWS Bedrock Titan embeddings (1536-dimensional)
- **Exact, prefix, fuzzy matching** with intelligent fallbacks
- **Language detection** via AWS Comprehend
- **Personalized results** based on social graph
- **Real-time indexing** with 90-day TTL

### 2. Cost-Aware Infrastructure
Every API response includes detailed cost breakdowns:
```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "cost": {
    "total_cost_micros": 234,  // $0.000234
    "breakdown": {
      "dynamodb_reads": 2,
      "lambda_ms": 45,
      "bedrock_tokens": 150
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Complete Developer Experience
