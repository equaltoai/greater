# Foundation Setup Complete - 2025-06-17 10:27:00

## Task Status
- **Task ID**: phase1-setup
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Project Initialization
- Created `package.json` with all necessary dependencies
- Configured TypeScript with strict mode for type safety
- Set up Astro with Cloudflare adapter for edge deployment
- Configured Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens

### 2. Development Tools
- ESLint configuration with TypeScript and Astro/Svelte support
- Prettier configuration with proper plugin order
- Vitest for unit testing with 80% coverage requirement
- Playwright for E2E testing across multiple browsers

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
- Automated linting, type checking, and testing
- Deployment workflow for Cloudflare Pages
- Lighthouse performance checks in CI

### 4. Project Structure
Created comprehensive directory structure:
```

│   ├── components/core/        # Static Astro components
│   ├── components/islands/     # Interactive Svelte islands

├── tests/                     # Test files
└── docs/                      # Documentation
```

### 5. Documentation
- Updated README with project overview and badges
- Created comprehensive CONTRIBUTING guide
- Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT for community standards
- Set up issue templates for bugs and features

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. License Choice: AGPL-3.0
- **Reason**: Ensures that any modifications to Greater must also be open source
- **Impact**: Stronger copyleft than MIT, protecting the community's work
- **Alternative considered**: MIT (rejected for weaker protections)

### 2. Svelte-Only Islands
- **Reason**: Consistency, performance, and smaller bundle size
- **Impact**: All interactive components use Svelte exclusively
- **Alternative considered**: Mixed React/Vue/Svelte (rejected for complexity)

### 3. Strict TypeScript Configuration
- **Reason**: Catch more errors at compile time, improve code quality
- **Impact**: More verbose but safer code
- **Includes**: noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes

### 4. Cloudflare-First Architecture
- **Reason**: Global edge deployment, excellent performance, cost-effective
- **Impact**: Designed specifically for Cloudflare's services
- **Services**: Pages, Workers, KV, R2, D1

### 5. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Reason**: Maintain high code quality and reliability
- **Target**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for auth and API client

## Technical Notes

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 20+ required for modern JavaScript features
- npm 10+ for workspace support
- Development runs on port 4321 (Astro default)

### Build Configuration
- Hybrid SSG/SSR mode for optimal performance
- Route-based code splitting enabled
- Brotli compression for text assets
- Image optimization through Cloudflare

### Security Considerations
- Content Security Policy will be configured
- No analytics without user consent
- Secure token storage in encrypted KV
- HTTPS-only in production

## Next Steps

1. **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** (phase1-core-auth)
   - Implement OAuth flow with PKCE
   - Multi-instance support
   - Secure token storage

2. **API Client** (phase1-api-client)
   - Type-safe Mastodon API wrapper
   - Error handling and retries
   - Request caching

3. **Routing Setup** (phase1-routing)
   - Basic page structure
   - Protected routes
   - Layout system

4. **State Management** (phase1-state-mgmt)
   - Zustand for global state
   - Nanostores for component state
   - Persistence layer

## Blockers/Issues
None identified during foundation setup.

## Lessons Learned
- Astro's configuration is straightforward and well-documented
- Cloudflare's Wrangler config supports multiple environments well
- GitHub Actions integration with Cloudflare is smooth

## Time Tracking
- Planning: 5 minutes
- Implementation: 20 minutes
- Documentation: 5 minutes
- Total: 30 minutes
