# Phase 3: Performance Optimization Complete

## Date: 2025-06-17

### Summary
Completed all performance optimization tasks for Phase 3 of the Greater client. The application now has comprehensive performance monitoring, code splitting, lazy loading, and automated performance testing.

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Route-Based Code Splitting ✅
- Configured manual chunks in Vite for vendor, mastodon, and UI libraries
- Implemented Astro's built-in code splitting with `functionPerRoute`
- Added inline stylesheets optimization
- Configured smart prefetching strategy

#### 2. Component Lazy Loading ✅
- Created lazy wrapper components for heavy components:
  - `LazyMediaGallery.astro` - Loads MediaGallery on intersection
  - `LazyVideoPlayer.astro` - Loads VideoPlayer on click
  - `LazyThemeSettings.astro` - Loads theme settings on demand
- Implemented loading placeholders with skeleton animations
- Used Intersection Observer for viewport-based loading

#### 3. Bundle Size Optimization ✅
- Installed and configured `rollup-plugin-visualizer`
- Created bundle analysis script (`npm run analyze`)
- Split bundles into logical chunks:
  - vendor: Core framework libraries
  - mastodon: Megalodon API client
  - ui: UI utilities (focus-trap, tippy.js)
- Current bundle sizes are well-optimized:
  - Largest chunk: `client.js` at 67KB (16KB gzipped)
  - Most components under 10KB

#### 4. Resource Hints Implementation ✅
- Added preconnect for fonts and API domains
- Implemented prefetch for critical routes
- Added DNS prefetch for potential API calls
- Created utility functions for dynamic resource hints:
  - `preloadResource()`
  - `prefetchResource()`
  - `preconnectOrigin()`

#### 5. Performance Monitoring with Web Vitals ✅
- Installed `web-vitals` package
- Created comprehensive performance monitoring utility
- Tracks all Core Web Vitals:
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
  - FID (First Input Delay)
  - FCP (First Contentful Paint)
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
  - TTFB (Time to First Byte)
  - INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
- Automatic reporting to analytics endpoint
- Development console logging

#### 6. Lighthouse CI Configuration ✅
- Created `lighthouserc.js` with comprehensive configuration
- Set performance targets:
  - Performance score: 90%+
  - Accessibility score: 90%+
  - Best practices: 90%+
  - SEO: 90%+
- Configured specific metric thresholds:
  - FCP: < 2 seconds
  - LCP: < 3 seconds
  - CLS: < 0.1
  - TBT: < 300ms
  - TTI: < 3.5 seconds
- Added npm scripts for performance testing

### Performance Improvements

1. **Build Output**
   - Clean build with no TypeScript errors
   - Optimized chunk sizes
   - Efficient code splitting

2. **Loading Performance**
   - Lazy loading for heavy components
   - Smart prefetching for navigation
   - Resource hints for external resources

3. **Runtime Performance**
   - Virtual scrolling already implemented
   - Optimistic updates for interactions
   - Efficient state management

4. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance metrics
   - Automated Lighthouse testing
   - Bundle size tracking

### Next Steps

With performance optimization complete, the remaining Phase 3 tasks are:
- Lists Management (Low priority)
- Offline Support (Low priority)

The application is now highly optimized for performance and ready for production use.

### Time Spent
- Approximately 30 minutes
- All performance optimization tasks completed successfully
