# Phase 3: Search Functionality Complete

## Date: 2025-06-17
## Time: ~30 minutes

### What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented comprehensive search functionality for the Greater client:

#### 1. Search Infrastructure
- **Search Store** (`src/lib/stores/search.ts`):
  - Full-text search state management with Zustand
  - Search history with localStorage persistence
  - Support for accounts, statuses, and hashtags
  - Optimistic loading states

#### 2. Search UI Components
- **SearchBar** (`src/components/islands/svelte/SearchBar.svelte`):
  - Updated to navigate to search page
  - Shows search history suggestions
  - Auto-complete from recent searches
  - Clear button functionality

- **SearchResults** (`src/components/islands/svelte/SearchResults.svelte`):
  - Tabbed interface (All, People, Posts, Hashtags)
  - Result counts per category
  - Empty states and error handling
  - URL-based search queries

- **UserCard** (`src/components/islands/svelte/UserCard.svelte`):
  - User display with avatar and bio
  - Follow/unfollow functionality
  - Stats display (posts, followers, following)
  - Bot indicator

- **HashtagCard** (`src/components/islands/svelte/HashtagCard.svelte`):
  - Hashtag with usage statistics
  - Trend visualization with sparkline
  - Usage trends (up/down percentages)
  - Links to hashtag timeline

#### 3. Hashtag Timeline
- **HashtagTimeline** (`src/components/islands/svelte/HashtagTimeline.svelte`):
  - Dedicated timeline for hashtag posts
  - Virtual scrolling for performance
  - Infinite scroll support
  - Loading states

- **Hashtag Route** (`src/pages/tags/[tag].astro`):
  - Dynamic routing for hashtag pages
  - Clean URL structure: `/tags/mastodon`

#### 4. Search Page
- **Search Page** (`src/pages/search.astro`):
  - Protected route with auth check
  - Clean layout integration
  - Query parameter support

### Technical Decisions

1. **Direct API Client Usage**: Switched from non-existent `useMastodonClient` hook to direct `getClient()` calls
2. **URL-based Search**: Search queries stored in URL for shareability and browser history
3. **Search History**: Limited to 10 recent searches, stored in localStorage
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: Reused existing virtual scrolling for hashtag timelines

### Features Delivered

- ✅ Search history with auto-complete
- ✅ Tabbed results interface

### API Integration

### Next Steps

With search functionality complete, the next high-priority Phase 3 tasks are:
1. Theme System - Light/dark/custom themes
2. Enhanced Media Handling - Galleries and video player
3. Performance Optimization - Bundle splitting and lazy loading

### Time Efficiency
