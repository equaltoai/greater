# Visibility Dropdown Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dropdown Going Off Screen
**Problem**: When the compose box was near the top of the viewport, the visibility dropdown would open above the button and go off the top of the screen, making options inaccessible.

**Solution**: 
- Added dynamic positioning logic that calculates available space
- Dropdown now automatically positions below the button when there's insufficient space above
- Added `calculateDropdownPosition()` function that checks viewport dimensions

### 2. Overlapping Text
**Problem**: The dropdown had overlapping text making options unreadable (as shown in the screenshot).

**Solution**:
- Increased dropdown width from `w-48` to `w-56` (14rem/224px)
- Improved layout with proper flexbox structure
- Added `flex-1` to text container for proper spacing
- Separated label and description with proper text sizing

### 3. Visual Improvements
**Added**:
- Checkmark icon to indicate selected option
- Better hover states with proper contrast
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Improved spacing and padding for better readability

## Code Changes Made

### ComposeBox.svelte
1. Added state variables:
   - `visibilityButtonRef` - Reference to button element
   - `dropdownPosition` - Tracks whether to show dropdown above or below

2. Added positioning logic:
   ```javascript
   function calculateDropdownPosition() {
     if (!visibilityButtonRef) return;
     
     const rect = visibilityButtonRef.getBoundingClientRect();
     const dropdownHeight = 240; // Approximate height
     const spaceAbove = rect.top;
     const spaceBelow = window.innerHeight - rect.bottom;
     
     dropdownPosition = spaceAbove < dropdownHeight && spaceBelow > dropdownHeight ? 'below' : 'above';
   }
   ```

3. Updated dropdown classes:
   - Dynamic positioning: `{dropdownPosition === 'above' ? 'bottom-full mb-2' : 'top-full mt-2'}`
   - Increased width: `w-56` (was `w-48`)
   - Added z-index: `z-50`

4. Improved option layout:
   - Added checkmark for selected state
   - Better text hierarchy with `text-sm` and `text-xs`
   - Proper flex layout to prevent text overlap

## Testing
The dropdown now:
- ✅ Stays within viewport boundaries
- ✅ Has readable, non-overlapping text
- ✅ Shows clear selection state
- ✅ Closes when clicking outside
- ✅ Provides adequate width for content
